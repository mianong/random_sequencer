# random_sequencer

An Ardiuno project to create a sequencer/random  generator  

Desired features:
  Step Sequencer
  Multi Channel
  MIDI out
  Random note generator
  Step editor, set notes (via buttons or keyboard pad?)
  Save / Edit note velocity in realtime via potentiometer.
  Save / Edit note velocity in realtime via potentiometer.
  Quantizer, fit notes to a key and scale
  Groove (swing) create step offsets
  
TODO:
(ok, there is lots to do, really this code doesn't really do anything)
Code 
Code UI
Code quantizer
Code groove values
Figure out Arduino to CV. what approach makes the most sense?
Figure out what CV outputs make sense 4 triggers? 4 pitch? 4 velocity?
